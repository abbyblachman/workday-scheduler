# workday-scheduler
A scheduler application that uses JavaScript and jQuery to save calendar events and reload them the next time the page is loaded.

This application demonstrates the following: 
- My understanding of using local storage to set and get items, using `JSON.stringify` and `JSON.parse`
- My understanding of how to create HTML elements and style them using a `for` loop and jQuery
